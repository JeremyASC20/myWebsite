            <p>I am a finance major student at Brooklyn Technical High School in New York City. I love learning, so I try to learn something new every day. Currently, I am learning Javascript with All Star Code. I love HTML & CSS because of the infinite possibilities that they provide for web development. I love numbers and statistics because they always tell me the truths. I am curious, that's why I question everything I see. "Come on, is this website even real, huh? " </p>

        <div id="text">
            <p>At the age of 7, I immigrated to America with my family from Fujian, a beautiful city by the coast west of the Pacific Ocean, in the province Fuzhou of China. In a family of four, I am the youngest and have an older sister, Chloe, who I love dearly. I speak English, Mandarin, and Fujianese, the dialect from Fuzhou, although I don't speak it as much now. As a bilingual, I love both the Chinese & American culture. Like most Americans, I eat fast food. On the other hand, like most Chinese people, I eat traditional food like dumplings on traditional holidays. I try to find the perfect balance between the two cultures. At home, I speak Mandarin with my family. Outdoor, I speak English. It is necessary for me to maintain this balance because I don't want to lack either one of the cultures since the combination of the two built who I am today.</p>
            <p>Growing up, my parents and especially my sister have significant influence on me. They teach me everything they've knew. They built the fundamentals of me today. However, I admire self-improvement because I believe humans are meant to constantly strive for the betterments of ourselves. I see significant changes throughout my years so far in high school. Before, I would never have the confidence to wish my parents happy birthday. Yet, recently I would kiss my mother, which she said I haven't supposedly done since I was 6, and wish them happy birthday directly. I try to step out my comfort zone now because I don't like to be restrained. I have many hobbies and I like to find people that share my hobbies. Nowadays, I want to meet as many people, which I cowardly prevented before, because that's what makes me happy now.</p>
